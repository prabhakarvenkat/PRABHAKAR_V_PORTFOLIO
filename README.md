> 🚀 A modern personal portfolio built with **React + Vite**

This project is a minimal yet powerful setup to showcase a personal portfolio using **React** and **Vite**, supporting Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and linting with ESLint. It’s ideal for developers who want a fast and clean React development experience.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React** – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite** – Next-generation frontend tooling for lightning-fast development
- **ESLint** – Pluggable linter for catching code issues
- **HMR** – Hot Module Replacement for instant updates during development

## ⚙️ Vite Plugins

Currently, the project can use either of the following official Vite plugins:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)  
  Uses **Babel** for Fast Refresh (default setup)

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)  
  Uses **SWC** – a faster alternative to Babel – for Fast Refresh

You can switch between them based on your preference and performance needs.
